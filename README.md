# TinySnore
Library for putting ATtiny25/45/85/13 to timed deep sleep in one line of code!

----------
# Disclaimer

This is the simplest possible way to make an ATtiny enter deep sleep, using only one simple function: **snore(*sleep_ms*)**. It will disable brownout detection and the ADC during the downtime, and there are currently no options to change this. It's just a quick "all guns go" to put the Tiny in a coma for a custom amount of time with a quick function call!

----------
# Explanation

If your ATtiny25/45/85 project runs on a battery, you'll quickly find out that optimizing your power consumption is **extremely** important. TinySnore is a quick way to do this! Let's see what you can do to lower your power consumption:

- *Can your project run on a lower voltage than 5 volts?* **Lower the voltage!** Use a 3V coin cell instead of 4 AAs! (6V)
- *Can your project run with a clock speed lower than 16MHz?* **Lower the clock speed!** Use 1MHz instead for the leanest power consumption!
- *Does your project sit idle for any amount of time?* **Use TinySnore to put it in a deep sleep during these times!**
 
If you have a **delay()** call anywhere in your code - try replacing with with **snore()**! Your ATtiny will enter a deep sleep during that time, and this can bring the power consumption all the way down to ***0.0047 mA***!

# Installation

**With Arduino Library Manager:**

1. Open *Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries* in the Arduino IDE.
2. Search for "TinySnore", (look for "Connor Nishijima") and select the latest version.
3. Click the Install button and Arduino will prepare the library and examples for you!

**Manual Install:**

1. Click "Clone or Download" above to get an "tinysnore-master.zip" file.
2. Extract it's contents to the libraries folder in your sketchbook.
3. Rename the folder from "tinysnore-master" to "TinySnore".

# Usage

You only need to know one command, snore()!

    #include "tinysnore.h" // Include TinySnore Library
    #define led 4 // Pin flashing LED is on

    void setup() {
      pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
    }
    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
      delay(5000);
      digitalWrite(led, LOW);
      snore(5000); // Deep sleeps for 5 seconds, then resumes from here
    }
